Travsify B2B has earned a reputation for applying the right mix of technology and innovative thought to create B2B solutions that deliver value and exceed customer expectations. As a result, Travsify is trusted by over 700 airlines, 1.5 million hotels globally and 3000+ travel sellers worldwide.
                                    <br>
                                    The Travsify White label is a SaaS solution purpose-built for sourcing, selling, and servicing air travel in any channel (direct or indirect). Using TWP, airlines and travel sellers can deliver superior travel offerings and experiences for their customers without the headaches of managing multiple APIs, air sources, servicing challenges, or complex/delayed payment and settlement. The system aggregates, normalises, and optimises global air content – 700+ NDC, GDS, and LCC airlines – and provides a cloud-based solution for selling air and hotel at scale in support of the entire Offer-Order-Settle-Deliver lifecycle.
